          <h2 >What is Solar Energy</h2>
          <p>Solar energy refers to the energy harnessed from the sun's radiation, which can be converted into usable forms of energy, such as electricity or heat. The sun is a powerful and renewable source of energy, providing an abundant supply of energy that can be harnessed without the emission of harmful pollutants or greenhouse gases.

            Solar energy can be captured through a variety of technologies, such as photovoltaic cells, solar thermal collectors, and concentrated solar power systems. Photovoltaic cells, also known as solar cells, convert sunlight directly into electricity, while solar thermal collectors and concentrated solar power systems use the sun's heat to produce electricity or heat water for use in homes and businesses.
            
            Solar energy has numerous advantages over traditional energy sources, such as coal or oil. It is a clean and sustainable source of energy that reduces reliance on fossil fuels, and can help mitigate climate change. Additionally, solar energy is increasingly affordable and accessible, making it a viable option for both large-scale power production and residential use.</p>

            <li>One of the most significant merits of solar energy is that it is a renewable and clean source of energy. Solar power relies on the energy generated by the sun, which is a constant and sustainable source of energy that does not emit harmful pollutants or greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. This makes it an environmentally-friendly and sustainable alternative to non-renewable sources of energy, such as fossil fuels. Additionally, solar energy systems can be installed on both small and large scales, making it accessible to a wide range of individuals and organizations. Solar energy has the potential to provide a reliable and sustainable source of energy for years to come.</li>
            <img class="img3" src="house.webp" alt="pannel">
            <li>Renewable and Sustainable: Solar energy is a renewable and sustainable source of energy that does not deplete natural resources or harm the environment. Unlike fossil fuels, which are finite and emit harmful pollutants and greenhouse gases, solar energy is abundant and emits no pollutants or greenhouse gases during operation.</li>

          <li>Cost-effective: The cost of solar energy has decreased significantly in recent years, making it increasingly affordable for both large-scale power production and residential use. The initial investment required for solar panel installation may seem high, but it pays off in the long run as solar energy systems require minimal maintenance and have no fuel costs.</li>

            <img class="img6" src="maintainenece.jpg" alt="">
            <li> Solar energy is dependent on the availability of sunlight. This means that energy production can vary depending on the time of day, season, and weather conditions. Unlike traditional power plants that can operate continuously, solar energy generation may fluctuate, making it difficult to rely on as a constant source of power.</li>
            <img class="img7" src="land.jpeg" alt="">
            <li> To generate significant amounts of solar energy, a considerable amount of land may be required. Large-scale solar power plants need to be built on vast areas of land, which can impact local ecosystems, wildlife habitats, and land use patterns</li>
            <img class="img8" src="clean.jpg" alt="">
            <li> Although the cost of solar energy has decreased significantly over the years, it still remains relatively expensive to produce. The high initial investment required to install solar panels, as well as the maintenance costs, can make it difficult for some individuals and businesses to adopt solar energy as a primary source of power.</li>
